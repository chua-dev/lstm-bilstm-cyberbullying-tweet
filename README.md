# Multiclass Tweet Pre-emptive Cyberbullying Detection (Deep Learning + NLP)

## Summary
Spend over few weeks of freetime to explore the comprehensive Deep Neural Net + NLP model training for applicable tweet cyberbullying detection that can help admin to handle tweet bullying. This model can perform detection up to 5 classes (drop 1 classes during cleaning) at training accuracy up to 98%, and validation accuracy up to 92%. Not perfect but pretty good tho, can be found in 'part2-cyberbullying-final.ipynb'. The best I can get without transfer learning.
